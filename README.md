# RecommendationEngine-Content-based-

This is a simple Content based Movie Recommendation Engine which only works on "Plot Keywords". I have used TF-IDF Vectorizer provided by sklearn library to create vector for plot keywords. The selected movie vector is then compared with other vectors by Cosine Similarity Score and the similar movies are then recommended by the system.
